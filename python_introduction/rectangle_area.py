# Task: Calculate the area of a rectangle.

# 1. Define two variables: length and width.
# As per the instructions, we'll use length = 10.
length = 10

# And width = 5.
width = 5

# 2. Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula (Area = length Ã— width).
# The result will be stored in a variable named 'area'.
area = length * width

# 3. Print the calculated area in the specified format.
# Using an f-string to embed the 'area' variable directly into the output string.
print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {area}")
